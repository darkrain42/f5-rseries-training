The r10600 is the base system, and PAYG licensing options exist to upgrade to the r10800 or r10900 models.  At intial ship there is an AC power version of the appliance and DC power versions will be made available in the future. 
The r10000 platform has 24 physical CPU cores / 48 vCPU's, however some of the vCPU's are dedicated to the F5OS platform layer. Additionally, some vCPU's are disabled on the r10600 and r10800 models to provide different levels of performance which can be unlocked through PAYG licensing.

Note that adjacent highspeed (40Gb / 100Gb) ports (1.0 & 2.0 or 11.0 & 12.0) must be configured for the same speed. You cannot have one port at 40Gb and the other at 100Gb. You can have ports 1.0 & 2.0 at one speed, and 11.0 & 12.0 at another. Also, the high speed ports do not support unbundling into lower speeds (25Gb / 10Gb), only 40Gb or 100Gb are supported. For the low speed ports (3.0 - 10.0 & 13.0 - 20.0) any combination of 10Gb or 25Gb is supported. The SFP28 ports are backwards compatible with SFP+.

Rack Mounting the Appliances
============================

An ideal environment for VELOS is to use a minimum of a 30” rack. The rackmount kits that ship with the system will support the minimum depth of 30” and can telescope to longer depths if needed. If the rack depth is less than 30” then custom rack mount kits will need to be ordered.

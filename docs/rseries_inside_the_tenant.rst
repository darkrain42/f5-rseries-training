rSeries Inside the Tenant
=========================


Once a tenant is deployed you can connect/communicate directly to one of its CLI, GUI, or API interfaces. At this layer you are interacting with TMOS, i.e. the experience should be almost identical to a vCMP guest with some minor exceptions. Day to day management of the tenant will use the same CLI (tmsh), API (iControl) and GUI as TMOS instances or hardware devices running within customer envronments today. If you are using vCMP today, then many of the concepts will be familiar. If you run and iSeries appliance or VIPRION in a bare metal mode, then there will be some differences as rSeries will be configured with at least one tenant, and lower layer configuration and stats will come from the F5OS layer.

VLAN Behavior
=============

In both VIRPION and iSeries with vCMP, VLANs are created at the vCMP host layer and added to physical interfaces or trunks. The VLANs are then assigned to a vCMP guest at creation time using the VLAN name. VLAN names are passed through to the vCMP guest as-is, meaning the names are unaltered. 

rSeries follows a similar behavior as far as tenants inheriting VLANs from the F5OS layer. At tenant creation time the admin will assign VLANs to the tenant based on VLAN ID. The rSeries tenant will inherit the VLAN names just as a vCMP guest will. Below is an rSeries tenant showing the VLAN names being passed from the F5OS layer that the tenant was configured for:

These are the VLANs as they appear in the F5OS platform layer. Notice that the tenant does not see all VLAN’s, only the ones that are assigned to it by the administrator:

**NOTE: There is a bug in the initial F5OS-A 1.0 release that prevents the VLAN names form being passed to the tenant. Instead an autogenerated name in the form of VLAN-<ID> will be passed to the tenant. this means that any VLAN configuration inside the rSeries tenant must be converted to utilize the VLAN name that is autogenerated or the VLAN must be renamed inside the tenant. In many configurations the VLANs are setup manually before migrating the configuration, but there may be parts of the configuration that may rely on the VLAN name itself. Some examples would be route domains that reference VLANs by name. You can delete the VLAN inside the tenant and then recreate it with a new name, as long as the tag value remains the same. The tag value is what will connect it back to the VLAN in the F5OS platform layer. The Journeys migration tool relies on a UCS restore procedure inside the tenant, and this tool will create VLANs with their proper names, and as long as the tag matches the VLAN configured in the platform layer the VLANs will be connected. This bug is currently being addressed and an F5OS-A patch release will address this issue.**


Interface Behavior
==================

The number of interfaces within a tenant will be based upon the number of vCPU’s assigned to the tenant. The screenshot below shows the interfaces inside the tenant lining up with the number of physical cores per tenant. In the example there are 36 vCPU’s assigned to a single tenant, this will equate to 18 physical CPU’s.

Trunk / HA Group Behavior
=========================

Within a vCMP guest Trunks can be used as part of the **HA Group** functionality to determine when a guest should fail over to its peer. 

An HA group is a specification of certain pools or host trunks (or any combination of these) that a guest administrator associates with a traffic group instance. The most common reason to configure an HA group is to ensure that failover is triggered when some number of trunk members become unavailable.
